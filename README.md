# current_month_web_calendar

This module can create calendar of current month. This is a table where the first row is a list of the names of the days of the week, and each subsequent row is a week in the current month.

Today is marked in orange.

You can click on some day and this action will put in the variable "count Milliseconds" the number of milliseconds since 01.01.1970 to the beginning of the clicked day.
